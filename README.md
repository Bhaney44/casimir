## About

Casimir is an all-in-one platform that allows users to trade, stake and track their assets while holding their own keys. One of Casimir's primary objectives is to reward crypto users for directly participating-in and strengthening the networks they rely on ‚Äì by helping them stake directly to the most reliable (big and small) validators on PoS networks.

**Supporting infrastructure and contracts:**
- [ü™ê IoTeX Stack](https://github.com/consensusnetworks/iotex-stack)

## Status

Casimir and its supporting projects are a work-in-progress ‚Äì we will share more soon.
