## About

Casimir is an all-in-one platform that allows users to trade, stake and track their assets while holding their own keys. One of Casimir's primary objectives is to reward crypto users for directly participating-in and strengthening the networks they rely on – through direct staking to the most reliable (big and small) validators on PoS networks.

**Supporting infrastructure:**
- [🪐 IoTeX Stack](https://github.com/consensusnetworks/iotex-stack)

**Tokens and contracts:**
- [🦮 NewFi](https://github.com/consensusnetworks/newfi)
